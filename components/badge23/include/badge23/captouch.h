 *
 * petal index:     0 is the top petal above the USB-C jack, increases ccw so that
 *                  bottom petals are uneven and top petals even.
 *                  TODO: LEDs are indexed differently, this should be harmonized
 *                  in the impending API refactor.
 *
 * captouch data:   full uint16_t range per stage, higher values indicate touch.
 * pad index:       defined in captouch.c
 *
 *
 * IOU: the internals are still subject to major restructuring and are not
 * documented as of yet. will do once the data structures actually make sense
 * and are not duct tape upon duct tape.
