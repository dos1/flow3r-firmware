// Only takes care of one captouch controller at once. Both captouch controllers
// are put together into a single view in flow3r_bsp_captouch.

// The AD7147 captouch chip is weird.
//
// It has 13 input channels, and can perform arbitrarily sequenced reads from
// these channels (then report the results of that sequence at once), but the
// maximum sequence length is 12 stages.
//
// That means getting 13 independent captouch channel readouts is tricky, as you
// need to change these sequences around to get all channels.
